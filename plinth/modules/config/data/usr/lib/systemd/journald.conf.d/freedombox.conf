# Upstream systemd project disables forwarding to syslog by default as it is
# only needed by syslog daemons that don't get their feed from systemd journal.
# See:
# https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/journald.conf.html#ForwardToSyslog=
# . Debian re-enables this by default due to support lacking in some syslog
# daemons in its repository. See:
# https://salsa.debian.org/systemd-team/systemd/-/blob/c39ab3efdc9c1b69f333c112112a68fb712cee27/debian/patches/debian/Re-enable-journal-forwarding-to-syslog.patch
# . In FreedomBox, rsyslog and other syslog daemons are not necessary and are
# burden on disk I/O. All the necessary log data can be obtained from systemd
# journal. Disable forwarding to syslog.
