=== About I2P ===
The Invisible Internet Project is an anonymous network layer intended to protect communication from censorship and surveillance. I2P provides anonymity by sending encrypted traffic through a volunteer-run network distributed around the world.

=== Services Offered ===

The following services are offered via I2P in !FreedomBox by default. Additional services may be available when enabled from I2P router console that can be launched from !FreedomBox web interface.

 * '''Anonymous Internet browsing''': I2P can be used to browse Internet anonymously. For this, configure your browser (preferable a Tor Browser) to connect to I2P proxy. This can be done by setting HTTP proxy and HTTPS proxy to ''freedombox.local'' (or your !FreedomBox's local IP address) and ports to ''4444'' and ''4445'' respectively. This service is available only when you are reaching !FreedomBox using local network (networks in internal zone) and not available when connecting to !FreedomBox from the Internet. One exception to this is when you connect to !FreedomBox's VPN service from Internet you can still use this service.
 * '''Reaching eepsites''': I2P network can host websites that can remain anonymous. These are called eepsites and end with .i2p in their domain name. For example, http://i2p-projekt.i2p/ is the website for I2P project in the I2P network. eepsites are not reachable using a regular browser via regular Internet connection. To browse eepsites, your browser needs to be configured to use HTTP, HTTPS proxies as described above. This service is available only when you are reaching !FreedomBox using local network (networks in internal zone) and not available when connecting to !FreedomBox from the Internet. One exception to this is when you connect to !FreedomBox's VPN service from Internet you can still use this service.
 * '''Anonymous torrent downloads''': I2PSnark, an application for anonymously downloading and sharing files over the !BitTorrent network is available in I2P and enabled by default in !FreedomBox. This application is controlled via a web interface that can be launched from 'Anonymous torrents' section of I2P app in !FreedomBox web interface or from the I2P router console interface. Only logged-in users belonging to 'Manage I2P application' group can use this service.
 * '''IRC network''': I2P network contains an IRC network called Irc2P. This network hosts the I2P project's official IRC channel among other channels. This service is enabled by default in !FreedomBox. To use it, open your favourite IRC client. Then configure it to connect to host ''freedombox.local'' (or your !FreedomBox's local IP address) with port number ''6668''. This service is available only when you are reaching !FreedomBox using local network (networks in internal zone) and not available when connecting to !FreedomBox from the Internet. One exception to this is when you connect to !FreedomBox's VPN service from Internet you can still use this service.
 * '''I2P router console''': This is the central management interface for I2P. It shows the current status of I2P, bandwidth statistics and allows modifying various configuration settings.

Only logged-in users belonging to 'Manage I2P application' group can use this service.
