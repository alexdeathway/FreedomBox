## BEGIN_INCLUDE

== Users and Groups ==

You can grant access to your !FreedomBox for other users. Provide the Username with a password and assign a group to it. Currently the groups
 * admin
 * bit-torrent
 * ed2k
 * feed-reader
 * syncthing
 * web-search
 * wiki
are supported. 

The user will be able to log in to services that support single sign-on through LDAP, if they are in the appropriate group.

Users in the admin group will be able to log in to all services. They can also log in to the system through SSH and have administrative privileges (sudo).

A user's groups can also be changed later-on. 

It is also possible to set an SSH public key which will allow this user to securely log in to the system without using a password. You may enter multiple keys, one on each line. Blank lines and lines starting with # will be ignored.

A user's account can be deactivated, which will temporarily disable the account.
