=== What is User websites? ===

User websites is a module of the Apache webserver enabled to allow users defined in the !FreedomBox system to expose a set of static files on the !FreedomBox filesystem as a website to the local network and/or the internet according to the network and firewall setup.

=== Using User websites ===

The module is always enabled and offers no configuration from the !FreedomBox web interface. There is no configuration or status page shown for this module in the !FreedomBox web interface.

To serve documents, place the files in the designated directory in a !FreedomBox user's home directory in the filesystem.

This directory is: '''public_html'''

Thus the absolute path for the directory of a user named fbx with home directory in /home/fbx will be '''/home/fbx/public_html'''.
User websites will serve documents placed in this directory when requests for documents with the URI path "~fbx" are received. For the the example.org domain thus a request for the document example.org/~fbx/index.html will transfer the file in /home/fbx/public_html/index.html.


=== Using SFTP to create public_html and upload documents ===
