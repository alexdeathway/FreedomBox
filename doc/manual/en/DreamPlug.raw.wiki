[[https://www.globalscaletechnologies.com/t-dreamplugdetails.aspx|DreamPlug]] is the hardware for which !FreedomBox has been originally targeted.  !FreedomBox images are built and tested for it.  For using this device as !FreedomBox, a [[FreedomBox/Hardware/USBWiFi|USB WiFi device]] that does not require non-free firmware is recommended.

You can find more support and discussion for !DreamPlug on the [[http://www.plugcomputer.org/plugforum/|official forum]].

'''Recommendation:''' If you are using a board that uses SD cards, when you flash the FreedomBox image onto your SD card, we recommend that you use an SD card with at least 8GB of storage space. 

=== Download ===

!FreedomBox SD card [[FreedomBox/Download|images]] for this hardware are available.  Follow the instructions on the [[FreedomBox/Download|download]] page to create a !FreedomBox SD card and boot into !FreedomBox.  See also instructions for using an [[FreedomBox/Hardware/DreamPlug/InternalMicroSD|internal micro-SD]] with !DreamPlug.

An alternative to downloading these images is to [[InstallingDebianOn/DreamPlug|install Debian]] on !DreamPlug and then [[FreedomBox/Hardware/Debian|install FreedomBox]] on it.
