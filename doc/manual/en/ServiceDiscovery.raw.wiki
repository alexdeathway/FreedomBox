## BEGIN_INCLUDE

== Service Discovery ==

Service discovery allows other devices on the network to discover your !FreedomBox and services running on it. If a client on the local network supports mDNS, it can find your !FreedomBox at <hostname>.local (for example: freedombox.local).

It also allows !FreedomBox to discover other devices and services running on your local network.   

Service discovery is not essential and works only on internal networks. It may be disabled to improve security especially when connecting to a hostile local network.
