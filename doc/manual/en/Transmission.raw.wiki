=== What is Transmission ? ===

!BitTorrent is a communications protocol using peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing. It is not anonymous; you should assume that others can see what files you are sharing. There are two !BitTorrent web clients available in !FreedomBox: Transmission and [[FreedomBox/Manual/Deluge|Deluge]]. They have similar features, but you may prefer one over the other.

Transmission is a lightweight !BitTorrent client that is well known for its simplicity and a default configuration that "Just Works".

=== Using Transmission ===

After installing Transmission, it can be accessed at {{{https://<your freedombox>/transmission}}}. Transmission uses single sign-on from !FreedomBox, which means that if you are logged in on your !FreedomBox, you can directly access Transmission without having to enter the credentials again. Otherwise, you will be prompted to login first and then redirected to the Transmission app.

=== Tips ===

==== Transferring Downloads from the FreedomBox ====

 1. Transmission's downloads directory can be added as a shared folder in the "Sharing" app. You can then access your downloads from this shared folder using a web browser.
 2. (Advanced) If you have the ssh access to your !FreedomBox, you can use sftp to browse the downloads directory using a suitable file manager or web browser (e.g. dolphin or Konqueror).
