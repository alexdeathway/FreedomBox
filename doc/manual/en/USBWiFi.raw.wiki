== USB Wi-Fi ==
!FreedomBox works on many single board computers.  However, many of these boards do not have built-in Wi-Fi capabilities.  Even when Wi-Fi capability is available, non-free proprietary firmware is required to make them work.

A solution to the problem is to plug-in a USB Wi-Fi device into one of the available USB ports.  There are many such devices available which do not require non-free firmware to work.  The following is a list of such devices that work with !FreedomBox devices.  Some devices based on these chips have tested to work well with !FreedomBox including functions such as access point mode.

=== Firmware Installation ===

The free firmware for these devices is not packaged in Debian yet. You can manually download and install the firmware as follows:

{{{
sudo su [enter password]
cd /lib/firmware
wget https://www.thinkpenguin.com/files/ath9k-htc/version-1.4-beta/htc_9271.fw
wget https://www.thinkpenguin.com/files/ath9k_firmware_free-version/htc_7010.fw
}}}
