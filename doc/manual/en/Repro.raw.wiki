## BEGIN_INCLUDE

== Repro (SIP Server) ==

{{{#!wiki caution
'''App removed'''

repro has been removed from Debian 10 (Buster), and therefore is no longer available in !FreedomBox.
}}}

## END_INCLUDE

repro is a server for SIP, a standard that enables Voice-over-IP calls. A desktop or mobile SIP client is required to use repro.

=== How to set up the SIP server ===

 1. Configure the domain at /repro/domains.html on the !FreedomBox.

 1. Add users at /repro/addUser.html.
    . {{attachment:repro_users.png|Repro Users|width=800}}
 1. Disable and re-enable the repro application in Plinth.

=== Port Forwarding ===

If your !FreedomBox is behind a router, you will need to set up port forwarding on your router. You should forward the following ports for repro:
 * TCP 5060
 * TCP 5061
 * UDP 5060
 * UDP 5061
