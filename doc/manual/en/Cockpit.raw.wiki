== Cockpit (Server Administration) ==

Cockpit is a server manager that makes it easy to administer GNU/Linux servers via a web browser. On a !FreedomBox, controls are available for many advanced functions that are not usually required. A web based terminal for console operations is also available.

It can be accessed by any user on your !FreedomBox belonging to the admin group. Cockpit is only usable when you have proper domain name setup for your !FreedomBox and you use that domain name to access Cockpit. See the Troubleshooting section for more information.

{{{#!wiki caution
Use cockpit only if you are an administrator of GNU/Linux systems with advanced skills. !FreedomBox tries to coexist with changes to system by system administrators and system administration tools like Cockpit. However, improper changes to the system might causes failures in !FreedomBox functions.
}}}

=== Using Cockpit ===

Install Cockpit like any other application on !FreedomBox. Make sure that Cockpit is enabled after that.

=== Troubleshooting ===

Cockpit requires a domain name to be properly setup on your !FreedomBox and will only work when you access it using a URL with that domain name. Cockpit will not work when using IP address in the URL. Using ''freedombox.local'' as the domain name also does not work. For example, the following URLs will not work:

{{{
https://192.168.0.10/_cockpit/
https://freedombox.local/_cockpit/
}}}

Starting with !FreedomBox version 19.15, using ''.local'' domain works. You can access Cockpit using the URL https://freedombox.local/_cockpit/. The ''.local'' domain is based on your hostname. If your hostname is ''mybox'', your ''.local'' domain name will be ''mybox.local'' and the Cockpit URL will be https://mybox.local/_cockpit/.

To properly access Cockpit, use the domain name [[FreedomBox/Manual/Configure|configured]] for your !FreedomBox.Cockpit will also work well when using a [[FreedomBox/Manual/Tor|Tor Onion Service]]. The following URLs will work:

{{{
https://mybox.freedombox.rocks/_cockpit/
https://exampletorhs.onion/_cockpit/
}}}

The reason for this behaviour is that Cockpit uses !WebSockets to connect to the backend server. Cross site requests for !WebSockets must be prevented for security reasons. To implement this, Cockpit maintains a list of all domains from which requests are allowed. !FreedomBox automatically configures this list whenever you add or remove a domain. However, since we can't rely on IP addresses, they are not added by !FreedomBox to this domain list. You can see the current list of allowed domains, as managed by !FreedomBox, in ''/etc/cockpit/cockpit.conf''. You may edit this, but do so only if you understand web security consequences of this.
