== Security ==

Press the ''Show security report'' button to see a report including the following:
 * Number of security vulnerabilities in installed version of !FreedomBox.
 * Number of security vulnerabilities for each installed app.
 * Whether each installed app supports security sandboxing.
 * For each enabled app, the security sandbox coverage as a percentage.

=== Configuration ===

When the ''Restrict console logins'' option is enabled, only users in the ''admin'' group will be able to log in via console, secure shell (SSH) or graphical login. When this option is disabled, any user with an account on !FreedomBox will be able to log in. They may be able to access some services without further authorization. This option should only be disabled if all the users of the system are well trusted. If you wish to use your !FreedomBox machine also as a desktop and allow non-admin users to login via GUI, this option must be disabled. You can define the list of users belonging to ''admin'' group in the [[../Users|Users]] section.
