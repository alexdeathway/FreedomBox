## BEGIN_INCLUDE

== BIND (Domain Name Server) ==

BIND enables you to publish your Domain Name System (DNS) information on the Internet, and to resolve DNS queries for your user devices on your network.

Currently, on !FreedomBox, BIND is only used to resolve DNS queries for other machines on local network. It is also incompatible with sharing Internet connection from !FreedomBox.

Note: This service is available only on networks configured as "internal" zone. It is not available when connected via OpenVPN.
