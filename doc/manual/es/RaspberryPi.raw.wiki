[[http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-b-plus/|Raspberry Pi]] (Model B+) is a popular single board computer developed with the intention of promoting  teaching of basic computer science in schools.  !FreedomBox images are built and tested for it.  For using this board as !FreedomBox, a [[FreedomBox/Hardware/USBWiFi|USB WiFi device]] that does not require non-free firmware is recommended.

''Note:'' The Debian architecture used for this device is `armel`.  This means floating point computations are done in software and most operations are slower than what Raspberry Pi is capable of. 

'''Recommendation:''' When you flash the FreedomBox image onto your SD card, we recommend that you use an SD card with at least 8GB of storage space.
